# Damien_Dots
This python program creates a replica of Damien Hirst's artwork using the Turtle module in Python. The artwork consists of a series of dots with random colors arranged in a grid pattern.

The Turtle module is used in this project. It is a part of the standard Python library, so no additional installations are required.

Once we run the file in main.py.....
The turtle painting window will open, and you will see a replication of Damien Hirst's artwork.
The artwork consists of a series of dots with random colors arranged in a grid pattern.
The program uses a predefined list of colors to randomly select a color for each dot.
The turtle will continue drawing dots and moving forward until it completes the entire grid.

You can also adjust the dot size and the distance between the dots by modifying the parameters in the turtle.dot() and turtle.fd() function calls, respectively.

BTW.....The original artwork by Damien Hirst is widely recognized and appreciated in the art community.
